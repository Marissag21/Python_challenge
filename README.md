In this assignment I created a script and gathered data from two different csv files. 

For PyBank, I calculated the total number of months included in the data set, the profit and loss over the entire period and the average of those changes. I also calculated the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits. 

For PyPoll, I analyzed the votes and calculated the number of votes casted, a complete list of the candidates and the total amount of votes they received, and the winner of the election. 

In the end, I created a script that printed the results to a text file. My PyBank did print out correctly; however, I could not figure out how to get my output for PyPoll to print correctly. Not all of the candidates printed to the textfile.
